Work in Progress. Design Portfolio 2020

Uses Node.js/Express.js to handle the admin side of the portfolio (app.js & public/admin/index.html) â€” create, write & update a small database in the form of a JSON file, as well as copy images to the required client directories when drag&dropped in the admin.

Once the JSON "database" is created, it uses pure Vanilla JS/HTML to display a static portfolio site (public/index.html).

Clone & launch with: nodemon app

Admin: /public/admin
