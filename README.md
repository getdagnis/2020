Design Portfolio 2020

Uses Node.js/Express.js to handle admin side of the portfolio â€” create, write & update a small database JSON file & copy images to the needed directories when drag&dropped in the admin.

Once the JSON "database" is created, it uses pure Vanilla JS/HTML to display a static portfolio site (public/index.html).

Run by: nodemon app
